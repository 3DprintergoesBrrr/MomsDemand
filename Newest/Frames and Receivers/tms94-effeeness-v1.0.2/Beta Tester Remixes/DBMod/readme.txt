FNS40_DBMOD

Function changes to frame:
-tightened the sear assembly pocket
-Looser tolerance for Magwell
-changed mag release in the horizontal axis to fit mag release
-added larger shelf for trigger safety
-thickened front locking block pin area
-thickened rear sear assembly/rail pin area - it is suggested you find a longer roll pin for this area to take advantage of the increase in material. 

Cosmetic Changes:
-Extensive shaping to grip
-P80 style trigger guard
-thickened the sides of the frame and added stippling sections
-added ribs to grip for added pleasure
-idk it’s totally different but also the same. 


I know the instructions say print Magwell down, I don't do that...seems to be great tho. Just clean out your supports ya noob.

I recognize the original developers put so much work into this frame. Thanks to TM18271998 and nguyenkvvn

This isn’t the greatest frame in the world. This is just a tribute. 


Oh...there's a magazine baseplate too. It matches the frame sort of. 

Thanks,
