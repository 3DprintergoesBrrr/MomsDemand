## Description
This is a printable frame for the Taurus PT-111 Millenium G2. Although also availible in newer variants (G3, G3C), as well as other calibers (.40 S&W as PT-140 G2), only the PT-111 G2 and G2C kits have been tested.

## Materials Required
You will need a set of each below for each [x] you make.
- x1 **Parts Kit** - You will need either a Taurus PT-111 G2 or PT-111 G2C kit. Note that the PT-140 G2, and the PT-111 G3C has NOT been tested yet.
- x1 **Steel Spring** - this is for retaining the magazine release button
- x1 **Magazine** - A magazine for the caliber of your choosing.

## Instructions

> Heads up! There's a PDF with pictures on how to assemble in the root of package!

1. Print with the following settings:
    - **Nozzle** - 0.4mm
    - **Layer Height:** - 0.16mm
    - **Temp:** - 220C/60C w/ eSUN PLA+
    - **Infill:** - 99-100%
    - **Supports:** - On (If using tree supports, press buildplate only. Otherwise use everywhere)
    - **Cooling Fan:** - 20% normal, 50% on bridges. Off for the first 10 layers. Keep the fan low to prevent warp.
    - **Bed Adhesion:** - For newer tempered glass beds, you may find it possible to print with just a clean bed like me. For smooth glass, use masking tape, gluesticks, or hairspray. 
    - **Orientation** - Print the frame upright. (This means magwell down.)
2. Gently file the inner walls of the mag until a magazine enters and exits per your retention preference.
3. Insert the magazine button steel spring.
4. Insert the magazine release, and align the steel spring. You may have to file the surface areas surrounding the magazine button for fitment.
5. Ensure the safety is in the rear fire-control module with detent ball.
6. Insert the trigger bar into the rear fire-control module. It should sit away from the safety towards the front of the frame.
7. Ensure the disconnector bar is in the rear-fire control module.
8. Install the front locking block and rear fire-control module into the frame as one assembly.
9. The largest pin goes into the front of the locking block.
10. The smaller pin (without the knurling) goes to the very rear of the frame into the rear fire control module.
11. The knurled pin goes through the middle of the frame and the rear fire-control module.
12. Perform a brief function check- pull the trigger back. Push down on the disconnector with the trigger back. Release the trigger. If any of these steps fail or if you experience any binding, something went wrong with assembly thus far.
13. Install the frame locking spring in the following order: spring, bushing, lever, all into the front locking block. Be sure to keep your finger over the front locking block to prevent the spring and bushing from flying out.
14. Assemble the slide, and perform a function test of the pistol.
