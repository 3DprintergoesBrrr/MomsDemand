If you make a cool remix, custom version, add-on, or other neat thing for the MacDaddy, you can submit it to be added as a remix!

Remixes are found in the remix folder - if you'd like to check some of them out, go read the Remix Index in that folder!

For simple remixes, Once you have designed, printed, and tested, you can send me (Ivan on Deterrence Dispensed Rocketchat) a .zip file that contains: STEP files, STL files, 
Renders (pictures of the real gun preferred, since I ask that you actually print and test everything), as well as a basic README - 
this readme only needs to describe the name of the design, the designer, and any other tidbits about it.

I'll review your submission, and if everything is up to snuff (all the files I've asked for are present and it's been tested),
I'll get it added to a collection of these remixes found here:

For remixes that add parts, change function, and require anything that the main build documentation doesn't cover, I ask that you provide all the things mentioned for the simple remix,
as well as pictures/text based instructions on how to properly assemble/use what it is you come up with (so that it is as accessible and the canonical package is).

Things that aren't quite remixes (more like add-ons or doo-dads that are compatible with or designed around the MacDaddy), such as printable sights, rail accessories, etc,
can be submitted the same was as I've described for simple remixes (unless they need special instructions/aren't completely straightforward, in which case they should be like a complex remix.

For questions about this system, you can contact me (Ivan on Deterrence Dispensed Rocketchat).
