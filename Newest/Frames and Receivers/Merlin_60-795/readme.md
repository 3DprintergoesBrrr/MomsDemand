# Project Merlin
Printable receiver for the Marlin 60/795 style rifles

By TJB556

## Description
The Marlin 60 and variants is the tube fed magazine while the 795 and its variants have a detachable box style magazine.

## Materials Required
60/795 parts kit (I try to stick to late models as they have the LSHO (last shot hold open) feature. 

## Instructions
Esun PLA+ preferred 
Print receiver with the top side on the bed. 
In Cura all I change from their recommendations is 225 nozzle temp, 50 bed temp, 10 walls, 8 top, 8 bottom and 99 Gyroid infill.  Tree Supports for the ejection port.  None are needed on the rear overhang or barrel opening if your printer is properly tuned.

Post processing
 I do a quick pass with a sanding drum for the barrel hole to clean it up. Depending on your printer settings you shouldn't have to do much work to get the barrel to fit.
For the barrel pin hole I use a 7/64 drill bit to clean it out.
On the 60 receiver a 19/64 bit can be used to clean up the tube hole to allow rounds a smooth transition into the action.

Depending on model and year the front of your action will be either held in place with screws or a cross pin from the factory.  If your kit came with screws just thread them into the holes and let them self tap.  If your kit was held down with a pin you can use a variety of methods (m4x8 screws, 3.5mmx20 pin, 5/32x3/4 pin..etc)
