# Shield9-ASP2.1
A reimagining of the Devel ASP, but on FMDA's S&W M&P Shield 9.

* nguyenkvvn - ASP 2.1
* FreeMenDontAsk - Shield 9 original model

## Description
The ASP 2.1 is a modern interpretation of the obscure, rare, and venerable precursor to compact guns- Paris Theodore's ASP, and Charles Kelsey's Devel. It is built off of FMDA's Shield 9 model. Enhancements typically found in the ASP and Devel include: round count window, and front hooked trigger guard. The ASP 2.1 incorporates a canted thumb-rest forward of the frame as well.

## Materials Recommended
