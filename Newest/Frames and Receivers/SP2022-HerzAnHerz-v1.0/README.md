# SP2022-HerzAnHerz
A revision of homethearmless' Sig Sauer (or Sig Pro) SP2022

* nguyenkvvn - HerzAnHerz revision
* homethearmless - SP2022 original model

## Description
The HerzAnHerz revision of homethearmless' original SP2022 model addresses some fitment issues (grip, hammer assembly, magazine), as well as introduces some ergonomic refinements (forward trigger guard stippling, under trigger guard stipping, handstrap stipping). In addition, rough edges in the frame were beveled out for less sharper handling. Designs of the magazine release button and the retention are included as well.

## Materials Required
You will need a set of each below for each [x] you make.
- **SP2022 parts kit** - You can check GunBroker or EveryGunPart. Be sure your parts kit includes the magazine release, magazine release spring, and magazine catch retention.
- **SP2022 magazine** - And of course, your magazine.

## Instructions
1. Print the frame grip pointing up. (Aka, print it upside down.) Reccomended tempeatures are: 45mm/s @ 230c; eSun PLA+ is strongly reccomended. Print magazine button and retention if needed.
2. Remove all supports from the model.
3. Assemble magazine release. (Some fitment required.)
4. Assemble trigger, with trigger return spring, and locking block assembly.
5. Assemble hammer housing.
6. Attach grip.
7. Function check with magazine.

ProTip: If your trigger is "sticky" or holds to the back, you might have forgotten to install the trigger return spring.
