Make sure you go to the fine folks over at https://ctrlpew.com/the-complete-getting-started-guide/ for a guide.

If you happen to have a few bucks, crypto coins, or have an Amazon account (especially if it's your company's Amazon account)
make sure to donate to the guys at Firearms Policy Coalition.  They are on the front lines of defending your rights in court, and don't give an inch.

You can donate to them in many ways like crypto, smile.amazon.com, or old fashioned donations at the link below.
